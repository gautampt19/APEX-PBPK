BACKGROUND: The endocrine disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA) has been facing stricter regulations in recent years. BPA analogs, such as the
bisphenols S, F, and AF (BPS, BPF, and BPAF) are increasingly used as replacement chemicals, although they were found to exert estrogenic eﬀects
similar to those of BPA. Research has shown that only the parent compounds have aﬃnity to the estrogen receptors, suggesting that the pharmacoki-
netic behavior of bisphenols (BPs) can inﬂuence their potency.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to compare the pharmacokinetic behaviors of BPA, BPS, BPF, and BPAF for diﬀerent age groups after environmentally
relevant external exposures by taking into account substance-speciﬁc metabolism kinetics and partitioning behavior. This comparison allowed us to
investigate the consequences of replacing BPA with other BPs.
METHODS: We readjusted a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for peroral exposure to BPA and extended it to include dermal ex-
posure. We experimentally assessed hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation kinetics of BPS, BPF, and BPAF to parametrize the model for these BPs
and calibrated the BPS model with a biomonitoring study. We used the PBPK models to compare resulting internal exposures and focused on females
of childbearing age in a two-dimensional Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis.
RESULTS: Within environmentally relevant concentration ranges, BPAF and BPS were glucuronized at highest and lowest rates, respectively, in the
intestine and the liver. The predominant routes of BPS and BPAF exposure were peroral and dermal exposure, respectively. The calibration of the
BPS model with measured concentrations showed that enterohepatic recirculation may be important. Assuming equal external exposures, BPS expo-
sure led to the highest internal concentrations of unconjugated BPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the replacement of BPA with structural analogs may not lower the risk for endocrine disruption. Exposure to
both BPS and BPAF might be more critical than BPA exposure, if their respective estrogenic potencies are taken into account. https://doi.org/

Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production–volume chemical and is
used in many consumer products, such as polycarbonate plastics,
epoxy resins, and thermal paper (Vandenberg et al. 2007). BPA
and its derivatives were found in more than 90% of over 2,500
urine samples in a U.S. study conducted between 2003 and 2004
(Calafat et al. 2008). European Union (EU) countries also face
widespread BPA exposure, as shown by the detection frequency
of over 90% in urinary samples of 600 child–mother pairs from
six EU member states (Covaci et al. 2015). There is growing evi-
dence that BPA exerts endocrine-disrupting eﬀects (Rubin 2011),
and therefore BPA has been facing stricter regulations in recent
years. Since 2011, the EU has prohibited the use of BPA in poly-
carbonate baby bottles and set a migration limit of 0:6 mg=kg for
the production of plastics (EC 2011a, 2011b). France has
expanded these restrictions and prohibited the use of BPA in all
food contact material since 2015 (French National Assembly and
Senate 2010). In the United States, where the use of BPA in food
contact material is generally permitted, there are restrictions for
baby bottles, sippy cups, and infant formula packaging (U.S.
FDA 2013, 2014).
Due to the stricter regulation of BPA, industry has increased
the use of replacement substances, such as the structurally similar
bisphenols AF, AP, B, F, P, S, and Z. In the following, we focus
on bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol AF
(BPAF), as BPS and BPF are extensively used, and BPAF has
been found to exert comparatively high estrogenic and antiandro-
genic potencies (Chen et al. 2016). In food samples from the
United States, BPS was detected second most frequently after
BPA (21% vs. 57%). BPF was detected in 10% of the samples,
but when detected, the second highest average concentrations
were found (Liao and Kannan 2013). BPAF was found in rather
low concentrations, with an occurrence of 11% (Liao and Kannan
2013). Apart from food, BPS, BPF, and BPAF are present in
indoor dust as ubiquitous contaminants (Liao et al. 2012a).
Another source of exposure to BPS is thermal paper, because
BPS has partially replaced BPA as a color developer (Thayer et al.
2016). This exposure route can substantially contribute to dermal
exposure (Goldinger et al. 2015; Hormann et al. 2014; Liao et al.
2012b; Rocha et al. 2015).
Several studies showed that BPS, BPF, and BPAF exert es-
trogenic eﬀects and partly exert antiandrogenic and thyroid-
disrupting eﬀects with potencies similar to or higher than that
of BPA (e.g., Fic et al. 2014; Rochester and Bolden 2015;
Skledar et al. 2016). All studies reviewed by Chen et al. (2016)
found that BPAF has a considerably higher potency than BPA
in the estrogenic, antiandrogenic, and antiestrogenic assays con-
ducted; for instance, the estrogenic potency of BPAF was found to
be 7 to 13 times higher than the potency of BPA (Kitamura et al.
2005; Stossi et al. 2014). Evidence suggests that only unconjugated
bisphenols (BPs) bind to estrogen receptors and that all are exten-
sively metabolized. In the liver and the intestines, BPs are mainly
metabolized to glucuronides, to a lesser extent to sulfates, and to a
minor extent to hydroxylated compounds and other metabolites
(reviewed by Gramec Skledar and Peterlin Mašic 2016). Most BP
glucuronides have been found to lack estrogenic activity (Li et al.
2013; Matthews et al. 2001; Skledar et al. 2016; Snyder et al.

days. 077002-1 A Section 508–conformant HTML version of this article is available at https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2739. Research 2000). Yet, the BPA glucuronide (BPA-g) cannot be regarded as
completely inactive, as it possibly induces adipocyte diﬀerentiation
(Boucher et al. 2015). Also, deconjugation is possible and may
even be more relevant in sensitive age groups, e.g., the fetus (in fe-
tal compartments and placenta, b–glucuronidase-mediated decon-
jugation of BPA-g is substantial, according to Ginsberg and Rice
2009; Lucier et al. 1977; Paigen 1989). As deconjugation may also
occur with BPA sulfate (BPA-s), the concentrations of unconju-
gated BPs could be considerably higher in fetal than in adult serum
(Reed et al. 2005; Tobacman et al. 2002).
The velocity and extent of the metabolism processes depend
on the exposure route (Mielke et al. 2011). Therefore, it is impor-
tant to consider the pharmacokinetic behavior speciﬁc to routes of
exposure when assessing the exposure and risk of BPs. For this
purpose, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling
is valuable. Several publications already addressed PBPK model-
ing of BPA (Mielke and Gundert-Remy 2009; Teeguarden et al.
2005; Yang et al. 2015), and they considered exposure via the per-
oral and the dermal route (Mielke et al. 2011). However, to the
best of our knowledge, no PBPK models are currently available
for BPS, BPF, and BPAF, although exposure to these compounds
is on the rise and their estrogenic potencies have been proven to
be similar or even higher than the potency of BPA.
In this paper, we have modiﬁed a PBPK model for peroral ex-
posure to BPA developed by Yang et al. (2015) so that it corre-
sponds well with a human kinetic data set (Thayer et al. 2015) and
includes dermal exposure. We have then parametrized this opti-
mized BPA model for BPS, BPF, and BPAF. To characterize the
metabolic behavior of the BP analogs, we conducted in vitro
experiments on their hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation. For
estimating tissue-to-serum partition coeﬃcients (PTS), we identi-
ﬁed the most suitable and relevant quantitative structure–activity
relationships (QSARs) from established models. A recent biomo-
nitoring study on BPS was used to calibrate the kinetic proﬁles of
BPS and BPS-g in the corresponding PBPK model (Oh et al.
2018). With a two-dimensional (2D) Monte Carlo (MC) analysis,
we investigated the interindividual variability and uncertainty of
the models. We used the PBPK models to compare internal expo-
sures after peroral and dermal exposures for diﬀerent age groups.
This comparison allowed us to investigate possible consequences
of a BPA replacement with its structural analogs.
Methods
PBPK Model for BPA
To model the pharmacokinetic behavior of BPA, BPS, BPF, and
BPAF (chemical structures, see Figure 1), we reﬁned an eight-
compartment PBPK model, which had been calibrated for BPA
in human adults using biomonitoring data (Thayer et al. 2015;
Yang et al. 2015). It consists of the compartments titled serum,
liver, fat, skin, gonads, brain, “richly perfused tissue,” “slowly
perfused tissue”, and two single-compartment submodules for
BPA-g and BPA-s in serum (see Figure 2). In the compartment ti-
tled “richly perfused tissue,” compartments were lumped with a
perfusion greater than 0:1 mL=min=g tissue (heart, kidneys,
small and large intestine, pancreas, spleen, and stomach), and in
the compartment titled “slowly perfused tissue,” compartments
were lumped with a perfusion smaller than 0:1 mL=min=g tissue
(muscle and skeleton) (Edginton et al. 2006; ICRP 2002, see
Table S1 for the aggregated parameters). When we translated
the model from the language AsclX to R, we noticed a discrep-
ancy between the model predictions and the biomonitoring
data, which is shown in Figure S1A. Together with Dr. Yang,
we identiﬁed a mistake in the published code: The constant for
the maximum velocity of glucuronidation in the gut had not
been scaled up according to the bodyweight (BW). Fixing the
scaling error caused the aforementioned discrepancy, and we
had to review and readjust the model parameters to the biomo-
nitoring data.
In a ﬁrst step to readjust and further develop the PBPK model,
we collected all studies that investigated the metabolism parame-
ters used in the model and gathered data from diﬀerent studies that
measured the same metabolism routes (see Table S2). In the fol-
lowing, we used all possible combinations of parameter sets in the
model and examined which parameter set reﬂected the biomonitor-
ing data by Thayer et al. (2015) for unconjugated BPA in serum
best. For this purpose, we calculated the mean relative deviation
(MRD) and average fold error (AFE) to assess precision and bias
of the model predictions using Equations 1 and 2 (Sheiner and
Beal 1981), as done previously (Ito and Houston 2005; Vogt 2014;
Yang et al. 2015). The resulting parameter set was used as the
deterministic, basic PBPK model. We also compared model out-
puts with biomonitoring data for BPA-g and BPA-s to ensure plau-
sibility in this respect [their MRD and AFE should also be low and
not exceed a value of 2 (Edginton et al. 2006)].

In our calculations, predicted was the value predicted by our
model and observed was the value measured by Thayer et al.
(2015), averaged over all test persons per observation point
respectively. Furthermore, n stands for the number of observation
points (28 for BPA and 15 for BPA-g and BPA-s). We compared
model output with biomonitoring data under two scenarios: one
that incorporated an enterohepatic recirculation (EHR) rate of
10% into the model (Yang et al. 2015) and one that assumed that
EHR was not occurring.
For the PTS of BPA, just like Yang et al. (2015), we used pa-
rameters from the experimental study of Doerge et al. (2011),
except for the skin compartment, which had not been investigated.
As Pskin=serum had been calculated with a QSAR, we recalculated it
with another QSAR that we also used for the other BP analogs
(see next section). After optimizing the model for peroral expo-
sure, we extended it to also include dermal exposure by using the
dosing procedure and parameters developed by Mielke et al.
(2011). Their model assumes that dermal exposure leads to a skin-
surface depot, from which the substance ﬁrst enters the skin com-
partment and then the blood compartment.
Parametrization for BPS, BPF, and BPAF
The chemical-speciﬁc parameters indispensable for adapting the
model to the BP analogs were the PTS and the metabolism

BPAF. Note: BPA, bisphenol A; BPAF, bisphenol AF; BPF, bisphenol F; BPS, bisphenol S. 077002-2 parameters for the Michaelis-Menten and substrate inhibition
enzyme kinetics, for glucuronidation and sulfation. To the best of
our knowledge, no applicable experimental data on the PTS for
BPS, BPF, and BPAF were available. Therefore, these parame-
ters were estimated with QSARs. Among the QSARs described
by DeJongh et al. (1997), Zhang and Zhang (2006), and Schmitt
(2008), we selected the relationship that corresponded best to the
respective experimental measurements for BPA from Doerge
et al. (2011) (see Table S3). We placed largest emphasis on those
PTS to which our model is most sensitive. For this, we calculated
residual sum of squares and maximal concentrations (Cmax) for
the concentration–time curve of unconjugated BPA after decreas-
ing and increasing the PTS values (Table S4) and identiﬁed the
PTS causing the greatest changes.
Measurement of Glucuronidation Kinetics of BPS, BPF,
and BPAF
We determined the glucuronidation kinetics of BPS, BPF, and
BPAF experimentally in both human liver and intestinal micro-
somes. We did not conduct additional experiments on BPA glu-
curonidation kinetics, as several well-conducted studies already
exist (Coughlin et al. 2012; Elsby et al. 2001; Kuester and Sipes
2007; Kurebayashi et al. 2010; Mazur et al. 2010; Street et al.
2017; Trdan Lušin et al. 2012).
For each substrate, we prepared at least eight diﬀerent substrate
concentrations in methanol (Table 1) and further diluted them in
the reaction mixture to a ﬁnal volume of 100 lL, containing
50 mM phosphate buﬀer at pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride,
the speciﬁc concentration of liver or intestinal microsomes
(0:1 mg=mL for BPS, 0:05 mg=mL for BPF, and 0:01 mg=mL for
BPAF), and alamethicin (5% of the total protein concentra-
tion). Pooled human liver microsomes (20 mg=mL) and pooled
human intestinal microsomes (20 mg=mL) were from BD
Biosciences. We ﬁrst placed the reaction mixtures for 30 min
on ice and then incubated them for 5 min at 37°C. The addition
of uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) to a
ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM started the reaction. For the
enzyme reactions, we used a temperature of 37°C; the incuba-
tion times diﬀered, subject to the BP and microsome type
regarded (Table 1). We terminated the glucuronidation reac-
tions with the addition of 10 lL perchloric acid (Merck). In
the following step, we put the samples on ice for 15 min, cen-
trifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and analyzed the superna-
tants using HPLC-UV.
We conducted the HPLC-UV analysis on an Agilent 1,100
series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies). For this, we
injected 10 lL of each sample onto a Poroshell 120 EC-C18
column (4:6 × 100 mm, 2:7 lm, Agilent Technologies) main-
tained at 40°C. The mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid (A)
and acetonitrile (B). The elution of diﬀerent BPs consisted of a
linear gradient (see Table 2). We further analyzed the results
with the GraphPad Prism software (version 5.04; GraphPad
Software Inc.,) and selected the most suitable kinetic model
(Michaelis-Menten or substrate inhibition, Equations 3 and 4),
based on the curve ﬁtting and the shape of the Eadie-Hofstee
plots (see Figure S2).

Calibration of the BPS Model with Biomonitoring Data and
Adjustments for the Other Models
Oh et al. (2018) conducted a study on the pharmacokinetics of BPS
in adults, which we used to calibrate the BPS PBPK model and to
draw conclusions on possible adjustments for the other models.
They perorally exposed seven healthy adults to 8:75 lg=kg BW
deuterated BPS administered in a chocolate cookie. Serum and urine
samples were collected within a 48-h period, and related BPS con-
centrations were measured before and after enzymatic hydrolysis
with b-glucuronidase. The b-glucuronidase used for the enzymatic
hydrolysis also contained low sulfatase activity (1:04 units=mL, in
comparison with 130 units=mL glucuronidase activity). The result-
ing concentrations were labeled “BPS total,” but it was acknowl-
edged that the sulfatase activity probably had not been suﬃcient to
release all BPS-s. Therefore, we considered the respective BPS con-
centrations measured being at least the sum of unconjugated BPS
and BPS-g. We derived the minimal serum concentrations of BPS-g
by subtracting the concentrations of unconjugated BPS from the
concentrations of “total” BPS. We could not draw any conclusions
on the extent of sulfation of BPS from this study.
In our PBPK model, we used the volunteers’ individual physio-
logical parameters and BW-speciﬁc single peroral exposures and
compared the concentration–time proﬁles observed in the experiment
with our model predictions. Subsequently, we adjusted the model to
get a good correlation with the biomonitoring data by staying as close
as possible to the kinetics observed experimentally. The calibrated
model was used as the basic PBPK model for BPS, including the
analog-speciﬁc glucuronidation kinetics.
Comparison of Model Predictions with Internal Exposure
Assessments
We assessed internal exposures for diﬀerent age groups to com-
pare the PBPK models for the diﬀerent BPs. This approach served
to compare the consequences of completely replacing BPA with
diﬀerent structural analogs. We compared the internal exposure
assessments stepwise, so that diﬀerent eﬀects would not overlap.
Table 3 gives an overview of the diﬀerent scenarios.
First, we compared predicted serum concentrations in adults
after a single peroral and a single dermal dose of 500 ng=kg BW,
respectively [rough average of peroral and dermal high exposure
estimates for adults by the EFSA CEF (2015)]. This comparison
is closest to available measurements, because BPA and BPS have
been measured in the serum of adults in the pharmacokinetic stud-
ies used to calibrate their PBPK models (Table 3, scenario 1). In a
second step, we used the same scenario to compare internal con-
centrations in the gonads of adults. These organs are especially rel-
evant due to their vulnerability regarding endocrine disruption, but
related concentrations are subject to higher uncertainty than serum
concentrations (Table 3, scenario 2). Thirdly, we compared the
models for the younger age groups infants (6 d–3 months), toddlers
(1–3 y), children (3–10 y), and adolescents (10–18 y) using age-

age-dependent diﬀerences of internal exposures with equal exter-
nal exposures per kg BW (Table 3, scenario 3). Last, we used envi-
ronmentally relevant external exposure estimates for BPA (instead
of the standard 500 ng=kg BW before) via both the dermal and
peroral exposure route as model inputs for all BPs [route- and age-
speciﬁc high-exposure estimates for BPA (EFSA CEF 2015; von
Goetz et al. 2017), see Table 4]. We simulated peroral exposure by
mimicking a diet with three meals per day within 12 h (Nicklas
et al. 2001) and dermal exposure by touching thermal paper and
using personal care products (PCPs) twice a day, in the morning
and in the evening (Garcia-Hidalgo et al. 2017; Liao and Kannan
2011). The simulation was run for 4 d, until we reached a steady
state (see Table 3, scenario 4).
To account for the multiple dosings, we divided the estimated
daily peroral and dermal exposure estimates into three and two
daily doses, respectively. As absorption fractions we used 100%
(EU 2008), 20% (Toner et al. 2016), and 60% (Biedermann et al.
2010) for peroral exposure and dermal exposure from thermal pa-
per and PCPs, respectively. As PCPs can also contain ingredients
enhancing skin penetration, the value of 60% for BPA dissolved
in ethanol was chosen. As dermal absorption half-lives we used
6 h for thermal paper (Demierre et al. 2012) and 10 min for PCPs
(Biedermann et al. 2010). As uptake periods, we used 15 min for
peroral exposure (Tsukioka et al. 2004; Völkel et al. 2002) and
24 h for dermal exposure, representing exposures after which
BPs are not washed oﬀfor a long time, so that they can penetrate
the stratum corneum, where they are protected from removal
(Demierre et al. 2012). All these uptake parameters were used in
all exposure assessments, and they are summarized in Table 5.
To interpret the results, we focused on comparing the Cmax and
the area under the curve (AUC).
Uncertainty Analysis
In an MC analysis, values are randomly sampled from probability
distributions deﬁned for variables of interest, which results in a
user-deﬁned number of realizations of the underlying model and
its output (Thomopoulos 2013). MC simulations can be used to
assess the combined eﬀect of several sources of variability and/or
uncertainty on the model output (Hoﬀman and Hammonds 1994).
For our model, following a tiered approach (EFSA Scientiﬁc
Committee 2016) parameter uncertainty was ﬁrst assessed quali-
tatively (see Table S5). For parameters categorized with a me-
dium to high (MH) or high (H) uncertainty, we subsequently
quantiﬁed the impact of uncertainty in a 2D-MC analysis. The vari-
ability of all parameters was assessed in an inner loop of 1,000 itera-
tions, and the uncertainty of the selected parameters was assessed in
an outer loop of 1,000 iterations, resulting in 2D-MC assessments
with 1,000 × 1,000 iterations for each BP. In the outer uncertainty
loop, we used trapezoidal distributions on the basis of parameter val-
ues that had been found in diﬀerent experiments, using the lowest
and highest parametrizations reported as modes and using the outer
boundaries of the related truncated normal distributions (see explan-
ations to variability distributions) as minimum and maximum.
We used coeﬃcients of variation (CV = standard deviation ðSDÞ=
arithmetic mean) to describe the relative extent of variability and
used a CV of 30%, if we could not derive a value from the underly-
ing data. In the inner variability loop, we randomly varied the model
parameters using truncated normal distributions to account for inter-
individual variability in a physiologically plausible way (95% of
the distributions= ± 1:96 times SD). We used either the values
drawn from the uncertainty distributions in the outer loop as mean
values or, if not applicable, the parametrization from the basic mod-
els. We conducted the analysis for serum concentrations of women of
childbearing age (18–45 y), because the models have been calibrated
with measurements in adult serum for BPA and BPS, and exposure of
women of childbearing age is the prerequisite for exposure of vulner-
able fetuses (scenario 5 in Table 3). In the following paragraph, the
derivation of parameters used in the 2D-MC analysis is described.
The parameters used in the uncertainty and variability distributions
are shown in Tables S6 and S7, respectively.
Uncertainty: For the PTS, lowest and highest coeﬃcients cal-
culated with the diﬀerent QSARs were used; see Tables 6 and S8
(DeJongh et al. 1997; Schmitt 2008; Zhang and Zhang 2006). For
BPA, the uncertainty was only quantiﬁed for the skin PTS, which
had been calculated with a QSAR.
For BPA metabolism, distributions were used that span from
the lowest to the highest values of vmax and Km for the glucuronida-
tion in liver and intestine (see Table S2). Metabolism parameters
are dependent on each other and reaction rates increase, when vmax
is increased and/or Km decreased. Therefore, random combination
of vmax and Km may result in reaction rates outside the range of ob-
servation. To avoid unrealistic reaction rates, we introduced a func-
tion calculating alternative boundaries for the sampling of vmax
after a certain Km has been drawn. These alternative boundaries
were recalculated for each inner loop iteration [see model code for
the 2D-MC analysis in the Supplemental Material (SM)].
For BPF and BPAF, we could not calibrate the PBPK models.
For their metabolism parameters, we used distributions spanning
from the parameters found in our experiments to the resulting
values when taking into account the deviation between measured
and calibrated BPS parameters (assuming the same proportional

al. (2002). Note: PBPK, physiologically based pharmacokinetic; PCPs, personal care products; TP, thermal paper. 077002-5 deviation from the values measured in vitro). We did not quantify
uncertainty for the glucuronidation of BPAF in the small intes-
tine, because four measurement points were within the concentra-
tion range of our model, so that the kinetics are likely to be less
uncertain.
For the peroral uptake of BPF and BPAF from the small intes-
tine to the liver and their urinary excretion rates, the values from
the calibrated BPA and BPS models were used as boundaries, to
take into account possible deviations after model calibration.
For the hepatic sulfation kinetics of BPS, BPF, and BPAF, the
vmax of BPA sulfation was multiplied with a correction factor
sampled from a distribution. The ﬁrst boundaries of the correction
factor distributions were the ratios between the hepatic glucuronida-
tion rate of BPA and of the other analogs at environmentally relevant
substrate concentrations. The second boundaries were the respective
reciprocal values. This way, we wanted to mirror hepatic sulfation
rates that are proportional or inversely proportional to the glucuroni-
dation rates. For BPF and BPAF, we determined these ratios both
with the original glucuronidation kinetics from our in vitro experi-
ments and with the kinetics adjusted to the ﬁndings for BPS from
in vivo data from Oh et al. (2018). We then used the outermost ratios
as boundaries.
For the fractions of BPA and BPS subject to EHR, we used
ranges of 20% around the EHR values that led to the best ﬁt to
the biomonitoring data, i.e., modes of 0–20% for BPA and 57–
77% for BPS. For BPF and BPAF, we used wider ranges and var-
ied the EHR rates of unconjugated substances and glucuronides
in the uncertainty loops (for BPA and BPS, we varied them only
in the variability loops).
Diﬀerent studies investigated the microsomal protein content
in the liver (Barter et al. 2007; Pelkonen et al. 1973; Schoene et al.
1972) and the small intestine (Paine et al. 1997; Zhang et al.
1999), and we set up distributions accordingly.
Diﬀerent values have been reported for the extent of dermal
absorption and its half-life (Biedermann et al. 2010; Demierre
et al. 2012; Toner et al. 2016; Zalko et al. 2011). For thermal pa-
per, we considered only studies in which BPA was dissolved in
water or in sweat simulants, whereas for PCPs, we considered all
studies available regardless of the solvent used.
Variability: We used normal distributions if not indicated
otherwise. The age was sampled from a uniform distribution
across the deﬁned age group range (18–45). We used height
distributions for adults with the respective SDs (CV of 6%) to
represent the Central European population (Motmans 2005).
For the body mass index (BMI), we used a log-normal distribu-
tion based on a CV of 20%, because a right-skewed BMI-
distribution had been found for the Belgian adult population
(Lebacq 2015).
Furthermore, we used a CV of 23% for the cardiac output
(Squara et al. 2007), 32% for the PTS (Doerge et al. 2011), and
27% for the organ blood ﬂows (Brown et al. 1997). We used a
CV of 25% for the tissue volumes (Henderson et al. 1981), which
we also used for the volume of distribution in the small intestine
(educated guess). To maintain mass balance and to ensure that
the sampled physiological parameters are physiologically plausi-
ble, we readjusted the sum of the randomly sampled organ blood
ﬂows and tissue volumes in a fractional manner. For this, we cal-
culated the deviations of the total sampled blood ﬂows and tissue
volumes from the required sums, respectively. We then corrected
for the deviated amount in proportion to the respective mean frac-
tional blood ﬂows and tissue volumes.
Kuester and Sipes (2007) investigated interindividual diﬀer-
ences in hepatic glucuronidation, and we derived CVs of 29% for
the Km and 36% for the vmax from their ﬁndings. We also used
these values for Km and vmax of the other metabolism pathways,
as there were no ranges available for hepatic sulfation, and only
pooled microsomes had been used in the studies investigating gut
glucuronidation. For the Ksi, we derived a CV of 33% from the
results of our experiments on gut and hepatic glucuronidation.
However, this CV does not fully reﬂect interindividual variabili-
ty, but rather a mixture of variability and measurement uncer-
tainty, because we used pooled microsomes.
We used CVs of 40% and 6% for the microsomal protein con-
tent in the small intestine (Paine et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 1999)
and the liver (Barter et al. 2007; Pelkonen et al. 1973; Schoene
et al. 1972), respectively. For the gastric emptying time, we
derived a CV of 27% from a study measuring gastric emptying
rates with varying peroral doses (Oberle et al. 1990). The CV for
the peroral uptake from the small intestine to the liver was set to
39% (Yu et al. 1996).
We used CVs of 31% for the dermal absorption fractions
(Toner et al. 2016) and 30% for the dermal absorption half-lives
(educated guess). We did not vary the peroral absorption frac-
tion of 100%, which is recommended for use in regulatory risk
assessments [EU (European Union) 2008], as this would only
lower the model estimates, and we did not want to trigger
underestimation in the variability assessment. CVs of 30% were
used for the uptake of BPA-g and BPA-s from the enterocytes
into the liver, the urinary excretion of BPA, BPA-g, and BPA-s,
and the EHR conversion rates from unconjugated and glucuron-
ized substances (educated guess).
Model Evaluation – Comparison with Biomonitoring Data
To evaluate the model, we sought to compare it with biomonitor-
ing data from literature that were independent of the data the ba-
sic models were calibrated with. Studies could be used only if
they reported concentrations and time-points of exposure, as well
as time-dependent and conclusive internal concentration proﬁles.
Such data to date are available only for BPA: Teeguarden et al.
(2015) recruited ten healthy male adults and provided them with
tomato soup that contained 30 lg deuterated BPA/kg BW.
Within the 24-h study period, venous blood samples were drawn,
and all voided urine was collected. In our PBPK model, we used
the volunteers’ individual physiological parameters and BW-
speciﬁc single peroral exposures.
Hormann et al. (2014) let volunteers wet their hands with
hand sanitizer before they held thermal receipt paper containing
BPA. Subsequently, the subjects ate 10 French fries with the con-
taminated hands, resulting in both dermal and peroral exposure to
BPA. We compared the individual systemic serum proﬁles of
BPA, BPA-g, and BPA-s measured in three volunteers with our
Table 6. PTS for BPA (Doerge et al. 2011; Zhang and Zhang 2006) and
BPS, BPF, and BPAF (Zhang and Zhang 2006).

bisphenol F; BPS, bisphenol S; PTS, tissue/serum par- tition coefficients; QSAR, quantitative structure-activity relationship. 077002-6 model predictions. For this, we estimated the external peroral and
dermal exposure, the extent of dermal absorption, and the dermal
absorption half-life according to the study design as described in
the following paragraph:
In one experiment, Hormann et al. (2014) measured the
BPA amount transferred to a hand wetted with sanitizer due to
holding thermal paper for diﬀerent lengths of time. After each
trial, they thoroughly swiped the hand and measured all BPA
transferred to the wipes. In our calculations, we assumed that
the highest BPA amount measured can be transferred to the
hands and is available for dermal absorption (mdermal1). In the
main experiment, three volunteers handled receipts for 4 min
with both hands, which were wetted with sanitizer (one receipt
per hand). Afterwards, both hands touched 10 French fries each
during a total contact time of 4 min. The French fries from one
hand were analyzed for their BPA content (moral). The volun-
teers ate the French fries from the other hand. Afterwards, one
hand of each volunteer was thoroughly swiped, and the trans-
ferred BPA was analyzed (mdermal2). The other hand stayed con-
taminated for the rest of the experiment (90 min in total). We
based our exposure simulations on one peroral and two dermal
doses. The ﬁrst dermal dose was 2  mdermal1 from 0–8 min (two
hands). The worst-case extent of absorption for the ﬁrst dermal
dose was ðmdermal1 −moral −mdermal2Þ=mdermal1. This share could
have been taken up within 8 min, and we calculated the absorption
half-life accordingly.
The second dermal dose was mdermal2 from 8–90 min for one
hand. The extent of absorption and the absorption half-life were
set to the values of the ﬁrst dermal dose. The peroral dose was
moral from 4–8 min. For the dose calculations, we used the indi-
vidual measurements Hormann et al. (2014) found for the vol-
unteers and kindly provided to us. We scaled all exposure
values according to the BW. Table S9 shows all input parame-
ters applied.
For BPS, the only available biomonitoring study (as of
April 2018) was used for calibration. For BPF and BPAF, no
biomonitoring data were available. Therefore, the internal
exposures of the BPA substitutes BPS, BPF, and BPAF could
not yet be evaluated against independent data.
Computing Software
We performed coding and simulations using the programming
language R, version 3.3.2 (see Supplemental Material for the
model code and related input Tables C1–C4).
Results
BPA Model Calibration
We successfully recalibrated the model of Yang et al. (2015) and
added a dermal uptake route (compare Figure S1A with S1B and
S1C). Incorporating the EHR pathway into the model as assumed
by Yang et al. (2015) improved the BPA-speciﬁc model to a
small extent (compare Figure S1B and C); however, it did result
in a considerably better agreement between measured and mod-
eled concentration–time proﬁles of BPS-g (compare Figure S3B
and S3C). We therefore used EHR in all PBPK models and an
EHR share of 10% in the BPA PBPK model, as suggested by
Yang et al. (2015), to ensure structural model consistency. We
used the following parametrization for the basic model of BPA:
Coughlin et al. (2012) for hepatic glucuronidation, Trdan Lušin
et al. (2012) for intestinal glucuronidation, and Zhang et al.
(1999) for the microsomal protein content in the small intestine
(see Table 7).
Tables 7, 8, and S1 show the model parameters used for BPA,
which were partly chemical or age group-speciﬁc. Table 6 shows
the related PTS.
BPS, BPF, and BPAF Model Parametrization and
Calibration
Regarding the QSAR selection to calculate the PTS for BPS,
BPF, and BPAF, Table S3 compares the PTS for BPA determined
experimentally (Doerge et al. 2011) and with diﬀerent QSARs
(DeJongh et al. 1997; Schmitt 2008; Zhang and Zhang 2006).
Varying the PTS between richly perfused tissue and serum led to
the highest changes of the residual sum of squares and Cmax
(Table S4). We selected the QSAR (2) by Zhang and Zhang
(2006) to calculate the PTS in the basic model, because the use of
this QSAR resulted in modeled results close to the experimental
values for Prichly perfused tissue=serum, and none of the calculated PTS
deviated more than a factor of 2 from the experimental values.
The QSAR by Zhang and Zhang (2006) takes into account that
substances can be partially deprotonated depending on the pKa
value. Although this is rather not an issue for BPA (pKa ﬃ10:4)
(Bautista-Toledo et al. 2005) and BPAF (pKa ﬃ9:2) (SPARC
2011), it is important for BPF and BPS, which are more acidic
(pKa ﬃ7:6 and 8.2, respectively) (SPARC 2011). The deprotona-
tion lowers the PTS for all tissues in relation to the serum com-
partment. Table 6 shows the PTS for BPS, BPF, and BPAF.
Figure 3 compares the glucuronidation kinetics of BPS, BPF,
and BPAF investigated in this study with the kinetics of BPA
obtained from Coughlin et al. (2012) at both the high substrate
conditions evaluated experimentally (Figure 3A) and at lower
substrate concentrations, which are more physiologically relevant
and could be investigated with the PBPK models (Figure 3B). At
high substrate concentrations, the glucuronidation of BPAF was
slower than the glucuronidation of BPA, BPS, and BPF, but at
lower substrate concentrations, the glucuronidation of BPAF was
the most eﬀective, and that of BPS was the least eﬀective of all
analogs.
Unfortunately, no studies were available on the sulfation of
BPS, BPF, and BPAF in the liver or the intestine. Therefore, we
used the hepatic sulfation of BPA as an approximation for the
other analogs in the basic models when comparing internal expo-
sures. To analyze the associated uncertainty, we varied the sulfa-
tion in the 2D-MC assessment and studied diﬀerent sulfation
patterns (see section below, “Uncertainty Analysis”).
When comparing the uncalibrated BPS model with the bio-
monitoring data (Oh et al. 2018), the concentrations modeled for
unconjugated BPS in serum were lower than the corresponding
concentrations measured and serum concentrations peaked later
in the model than in the measurements (see top row in Figure
S3A). We adjusted this with an increase of the peroral uptake rate
from the small intestine to the liver. Table S10 shows PBPK model
parameters for BPS before and after the calibration (visual ﬁt). For
BPS-g, concentrations measured were much lower than concentra-
tions modeled (see bottom row in Figure S3A). Lowering the glu-
curonidation and increasing the clearance rates in the model led
to a better ﬁt, but the modeled concentrations decreased much
faster than measured (see Figure S3B). A possible explanation
for this delay might be that BPS undergoes EHR, and, indeed,
the introduction of EHR into the PBPK model (with a share of
67%) improved the correlation between measured and modeled
concentration-time proﬁles substantially, as depicted in Figure
S3C. Unfortunately, no data were available to validate the
PBPK models of BPF and BPAF. Due to similarities in molecu-
lar weight and chemical structure, we used the BPA model cali-
bration for BPF, and the BPS model calibration for BPAF in
the basic models, for parameters related to uptake from small

calibration for BPAF in the basic models, for parameters related to uptake from small 077002-7 intestine to liver, and urinary excretion. EHR was reported to
depend on molecular weight (Roberts et al. 2002). As BPF has
a lower molecular weight than BPA, and BPAF a higher molec-
ular weight than BPS, we used EHR rates of 0% and 70% for
BPF and BPAF, respectively (educated guess).

Assessments. Figure 4A shows serum concentrations of unconju-
gated BPA, BPS, BPF, and BPAF in female and male adults after

uptake routes, with BPS leading to the highest Cmax for both expo-
sure routes. BPAF showed the lowest Cmax for both routes with
comparatively higher concentrations after dermal exposure, e.g., the
Cmax in serum of female adults were 1:79 pM and 7:66 pM after per-
oral and dermal external exposure, respectively. Estimated gonadal
concentrations after the same exposures are shown in Figure 4B.
We observed that the highest internal maximal concentrations were
reached with BPS after peroral exposure and with BPA after dermal
exposure. Figures S4–S7 illustrate age-dependent diﬀerences of in-
ternal exposures. After equal peroral exposure per kg BW, the Cmax
was the highest for infants, followed by toddlers, children, adoles-
cents, and adults. After dermal exposure, the order was almost
reversed, with adults obtaining the highest Cmax.
To illustrate possible consequences of future BPA replace-
ments, we modeled internal exposures by assuming 100% replace-
ment of BPA by each analog, respectively (see Table 4 for
external exposures). Figure 5 shows the eﬀects of the diﬀerent per-
oral and dermal exposures on the concentration–time proﬁles for
the unconjugated BPs. As shown in Table 4, infants, toddlers, and
children were primarily exposed via the peroral route, with chil-
dren being considerably exposed also via the dermal route. For
infants and toddlers, the ﬁrst peaks in serum and gonads were
nearly as high as the corresponding highest peaks; e.g., for BPF in
serum of female infants, the ﬁrst Cmax of 60 pM (t = 46 min) was
99% of the highest Cmax at 37 h. BP concentrations in serum and
gonads of children, adolescents, and adults increased over a longer
time period, and for all BPs but BPS, the ﬁrst peaks were
considerably lower than the corresponding highest peaks (e.g., for
BPF in serum of female adolescents, the ﬁrst Cmax of 11 pM
(t = 46 min) was only 28% of the highest Cmax at 85 h). The con-
centration curves for dermally applied BPs plateaued within the
modeled time period (see Figure 5).
For BPAF, even in children, dermal exposure contributed
most to internal concentrations of unconjugated BPAF, although
the external dermal exposure was lower than the external peroral
exposure (Table 4). This can be seen in the steady-state phase of
the BPAF proﬁles (Figure 5): In serum, for example, the peaks
resulting from peroral exposure (e.g., 8:7 pM at t = 73 h) contrib-
uted only 33% to the total concentration, because of the substan-
tial background concentration from dermal exposure (5:8 pM at
t = 72 h).
Table 9 shows the maximum Cmax and AUC obtained with
exposure scenario 4 and the associated exposed age group and
sex. In serum and gonads, the highest Cmax was estimated to
occur in female toddlers (BPA, BPS, and BPF) and male adoles-
cents (BPAF). By contrast, the highest AUC was estimated to
occur in male adolescents (BPA, BPF, and BPAF) and male chil-
dren (BPS). When comparing the diﬀerent BP analogs, BPS ex-
posure resulted in the highest concentrations in serum and
gonads.

high uncertainty (see Table S5). Figure 6 shows the cumulative
density functions (CDFs) for AUC and Cmax of unconjugated
BPs in serum of women of childbearing age in the 2D-MC analy-
sis, and Table 10 shows the associated summary statistics. In
general, 90% of the predicted variability fell within less than one
order of magnitude.
A comparison of the CDFs of the basic models with the ones
of the diﬀerent percentiles from the uncertainty iterations
revealed that the basic model predicted comparatively high con-
centrations of unconjugated BPs in serum. BPAF generally
showed the lowest and BPS the highest values for AUC and Cmax
(see Table 10). Internal concentrations were rather similar for
BPA and BPF. There was only little overlap of the BPAF-CDFs
with CDFs of other analogs, whereas there was some overlap of
the BPA- and BPF-CDFs with the BPS-CDFs.
Model Evaluation—Comparison to Biomonitoring Data
The adapted and recalibrated PBPK model for BPA was com-
pared to two BPA biomonitoring studies, see Table S9 for input
parameters applied (Hormann et al. 2014; Teeguarden et al.
2015). Table 11 compares measured and predicted pharmacoki-
netic parameters for unconjugated BPA, BPA-g, and BPA-s.
Regarding the study by Teeguarden et al. (2015), the predicted
average values for Cmax were 1.3 to 3 times and for AUC 1.4 to
1.6 times higher than the measured values. The average timing of
maximum concentration obtained with our model was similar
(BPA-s, BPA-g) or lower (BPA) than measured. When compar-
ing the ranges of measured and predicted values, all predicted
ranges for the AUCs were within the ranges of measurements.
Regarding the study by Hormann et al. (2014), Figure S8 addi-
tionally illustrates the diﬀerences between measured and modeled
individual serum proﬁles of BPA, BPA-g, and BPA-s in three
volunteers. Measured serum concentrations of unconjugated BPA
were diﬀerent for the two women and the man, with considerably
higher measured values for the women (Cmax of 5.86, 5.03, and
0:42 ng=mL for the two women and the man respectively, shown
in Figure S8). The course of the concentration–time curves of
BPA-g and BPA-s did not vary considerably among the three
subjects. Using the parameters derived from the study protocol,
our model corresponded well with the concentrations of unconju-
gated BPA measured in the two women, but it overestimated the
unconjugated BPA concentrations for the man and the BPA-g
and BPA-s time curves of all subjects.
Discussion
Model Calibration and Parametrization
When readjusting the BPA PBPK model with diﬀerent parameter
sets, we achieved good agreements when we assumed that no
EHR was occurring, but also for 10% of BPA undergoing EHR
(see Figure S1B and S1C). Multiple studies have measured pa-
rameters related to hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation, and
there was a large range of reported values for Km and vmax,
respectively (see Table S2). This variability could have been
caused by individual-based diﬀerences in glucuronidation activ-
ities, which also inﬂuence the performance of pooled microsomes
(Kuester and Sipes 2007; Street et al. 2017), or by diﬀerences in
experimental techniques and equipment.
The calibration of the BPS PBPK model with the biomonitor-
ing data by Oh et al. (2018) revealed that BPS is likely to
undergo EHR, which is also supported by their observation of a
half-life 2.7 times longer than the half-life of BPA. For other glu-
curonized compounds, such as the medications lorazepam and
retigabine, biliary excretion and EHR have been reported
(Herman et al. 1989; Hiller et al. 1999). The likelihood of chemi-
cals to undergo EHR was found to correlate with the molecular
weight of the metabolite, and a threshold of 500 to 600 g=mol is
estimated for humans (Roberts et al. 2002). The molecular weight
of BPS-g is higher than that of BPA-g (426 vs. 404 g=mol),
which supports the assumption that the occurrence of EHR
depends on molecular weight. On this basis, EHR might be even
more likely for BPAF-g ( 512 g=mol) and the least likely for
BPF-g ( 376 g=mol). However, molecular weight may not be the
only relevant parameter for EHR, because it has been observed that,
e.g., estradiol and estron undergo EHR to a diﬀerent extent,
although the two molecules’ molecular weights diﬀer by only
2 g=mol (Roberts et al. 2002). With an EHR pathway, unconjugated
and glucuronized BPs stay longer in the human body, partly in
conjugation-deconjugation cycles, with associated enhanced eﬀects
on endocrine receptors. Therefore, the occurrence and extent of
EHR in the pharmacokinetics of BPs need further investigation.
Regarding the parametrization of BPS, BPF, and BPAF, we

the small intestine. Additionally, our results suggest that the reac-
tion rates depend on the concentration range considered and that,
in humans, far lower concentration ranges exist than those that
are normally investigated in in vitro studies (Figure 3). As
Michaelis-Menten and substrate inhibition kinetics are approxi-
mations based on measured data, and in most cases, there were
more measurement points at higher concentrations, one should
note that the extrapolations toward the lower concentration
ranges might not be as good as extrapolations toward higher
concentrations. This discrepancy was seen during the calibration
of the BPS PBPK model with the biomonitoring data by Oh et al.
(2018), where we had to adjust the parameters related to the glu-
curonidation kinetics within the ranges of the respective variabili-
ty distributions. However, the diﬀerent extent of metabolism of
BPA and BPS was well represented. For future kinetic studies,
we therefore encourage metabolic tests that focus on the concen-
tration range expected after environmentally relevant exposure to
lower the uncertainty related to extrapolation.

bisphenol AF; BPF, bisphenol F; BPS, bisphenol S; c, concentration; PBPK, physiologically based pharmacokinetic. 077002-11 The development of PBPK models for the BP analogs described
here focused on embedding new glucuronidation parameters for
BPS, BPF, and BPAF. Multiple pharmacokinetic studies on BPA
conducted in vivo identiﬁed BPA-g as the main metabolite, and the
fraction of BPA-s formed was small: In one study, BPA-s repre-
sented only 3% of the total excreted BPA (Thayer et al. 2015) and in
another study 0.5–4.8% of metabolites present in plasma after pero-
ral exposure of neonatal mice (Draganov et al. 2015). Also, the
contributions from other veriﬁed BPA metabolites, such as hydroxy-
lated BPA, BPA-bis-sulfate, and the mixed sulfate/glucuronide bis-
conjugatearerelativelyminor, andtheirformationkinetics arepartly
unclear (Gramec Skledar and Peterlin Mašic 2016; Thayer et al.
2015). Furthermore, for other compounds such as some pharmaceut-
icals, the largest share of phase 2 metabolism in human cells
was shown to be through glucuronidation (Hewitt et al. 2001).
Nevertheless, a limitation of the models is that we did not have ex-
perimental values for metabolism pathways other than glucuronida-
tion for BPS, BPF, and BPAF, e.g., hepatic sulfation. We used the
sulfation kinetics of BPA as a surrogate in the basic models for the
analogs, which allowed us to focus on internal concentration diﬀer-
ences caused by the diﬀerent extents of glucuronidation that had
been measured for the diﬀerent BPs. In the 2D-MC analysis, we
used ranges of possible sulfation kinetics taking into account that he-
patic sulfation rates could be proportional or inversely proportional
to hepatic glucuronidation rates. These assumptions seemed to be
most reasonable with regard to the data available. Also, just like
Yang et al., we were confronted with the lack of data on intestinal
sulfation for BPs. In the absence of any reference point, we could not
incorporate intestinal sulfation into our models. However, Figure 3
suggests that glucuronidation rates in the liver are considerably
higher than in the small intestine. At the same time, in the basic
BPA model, the vmax of hepatic sulfation was about 60 times
lower than that of hepatic glucuronidation. These ﬁndings sug-
gest that intestinal sulfation is probably no key pathway for BP
metabolism. Regarding varying extents of hepatic sulfation, the
results of the 2D-MC analysis (Figure 6 and Table 10) suggest
that internal concentrations were by far the lowest for BPAF and
by far the highest for BPS, e.g., for the Cmax, the P5 of BPS uncer-
tainty was still higher than the P95 of BPAF uncertainty for all
variability percentiles. This diﬀerence suggests that parameters
varied in the uncertainty loop, such as hepatic sulfation, will
probably not cause major shifts in internal concentrations of un-
conjugated BPs.
However, the metabolism of other BPs does not necessarily
need to follow the patterns we saw when comparing hepatic glu-
curonidation and sulfation for BPA. A pilot study on BPF metab-
olism with three subjects showed subject-speciﬁc diﬀerences,
with glucuronidation being the only metabolism pathway for two
subjects, and BPF-s being the major metabolite (75%) for the
third subject (the oldest volunteer with 82 y) (Dumont et al.
2011). In this context, we want to point out again that we could
not calibrate the PBPK models for BPF and BPAF, and the con-
jugation with sulfate for BPS with appropriate in vivo data.
Future studies may therefore focus on (a) the acquisition of in vivo
toxicokinetic data for BPS, BPF, and BPAF (explicitly diﬀerenti-
ating between glucuronidation and sulfation), e.g., with con-
trolled biomonitoring and/or animal studies, and (b) the sulfation
kinetics of all BP analogs.
Model Evaluation – Comparison to Biomonitoring Data
The model evaluation with the biomonitoring study by Teeguarden
et al. (2015) showed that predicted average values for Cmax and
AUC were 1.3 to 3 times higher than measured (Table 11).
Important diﬀerences between the studies by Thayer et al. (2015),
which was used for calibrating the PBPK model, and Teeguarden
et al. (2015) were the dosed amounts, dosing vehicles, and fasting
conditions used. In relative terms, the study by Thayer et al.
(2015) led to higher concentrations of unconjugated BPA than the
study by Teeguarden et al. (2015). Dosing vehicles (cookie vs.
soup) could have an inﬂuence on the uptake of BPA (Yang et al.
2015). Also, the breakfast before the BPA dosing (Teeguarden
et al. 2015) could have inﬂuenced the peroral uptake in comparison
with the BPA dosing after a fasting period (Thayer et al. 2015).

BPAF, bisphenol AF; BPF, bisphenol F; BPS, bisphenol S; Cmax, maximal concentration; P, percentile. 077002-12 The comparison with biomonitoring data investigated by
Hormann et al. (2014) showed that the basic model could predict
BPA serum concentrations of the two female subjects, but neither
the BPA serum concentrations of the male subject nor concentra-
tions of BPA-g and BPA-s for all three subjects. This only partial
match might be due to our model not including all aspects neces-
sary for this case. One possible explanation could be a lower
extent of glucuronidation for the two female subjects than mod-
eled, as important enzymes for glucuronidation can be expressed
polymorphically (Hanioka et al. 2008; Skledar et al. 2015).
Another possible explanation might be that the excretion of glu-
curonide and sulfate is subject to high variability and was more
eﬀective in the study by Hormann et al. (2014). This would be in
line with the fast elimination of BPS-g observed by Oh et al.
(2018), but not in line with other BPA biomonitoring studies
(Teeguarden et al. 2015; Thayer et al. 2015; Völkel et al. 2002).
An increase of the EHR percentage would rather not improve
the match between model predictions and measurements, as
measurements were lower than modeled concentrations if the
deviation were substantial. Raising the EHR percentage would
increase the residence time of BPA and BPA-g and would lead
to even higher AUCs of modeled concentrations. Finally, with
only three subjects in the scenario modeled, the sample size is
too small to conclude on rationales, and further studies on
human volunteers are needed to examine reasons behind the
observed diﬀerences.
Internal Exposure Assessments
Our results suggest that dermal exposure could be of high impor-
tance with respect to endocrine disrupting eﬀects of BPs, because
both BP uptake and excretion occurred later after dermal than after
peroral exposure, and concentrations of unconjugated BPs in se-
rum and tissues were elevated over a longer time period. This pat-
tern was also observed by Mielke et al. (2011), who modeled BPA
concentration–time proﬁles in blood, liver, and kidney after der-
mal, peroral, and aggregate dermal and peroral exposures. The pro-
longed rise of the internal unconjugated BP concentration–time
curves due to dermal exposure might considerably inﬂuence the
AUC, which represents the total exposure over time and is a good
biomarker for chronic eﬀects. Our results also suggest that replacing
BPA byits structural analogs couldresult in similar pharmacokinetic
patterns, with higher estimated serum concentrations predicted for
some BPs. Gonadal BPA concentrations were mostly higher than
those of other analogs, due to BPA having the highest PTS gonads/
serum of all BPs in our models. The concentrations in gonads were
mostly modeled based on QSAR-derived partitioning coeﬃcients,
so that they are more uncertain than the serum levels. However, they
are particularly relevant for risk assessment and practically unmea-
surable in humans, so that pharmacokinetic models currently repre-
sent the only possibility to predict them.
Serum concentration diﬀerences after peroral exposure can
probably be directly attributed to the diﬀerences in hepatic and
intestinal glucuronidation rates among the analogs. After dermal
exposure, intestinal glucuronidation most likely does not play a
role, and BPs are present in the serum prior to hepatic glucuroni-
dation. Therefore, the PTS skin/serum and serum/liver become
more inﬂuential. The curve shapes of the concentration-time pro-
ﬁles after peroral and dermal exposure diﬀer largely because of
the diﬀerent extent of metabolism and the diﬀerences between
dermal and peroral absorption half-lives. As seen in the basic
model results for BPAF (Table 9), the highest Cmax and AUC
in serum and gonads were observed in male adolescents.
Adolescents obtained the highest external dermal exposures
(Table 4), which suggests that this exposure route is especially
important for BPAF exposure. This could be caused by the com-
paratively high lipophilicity of BPAF (logPow of about 2.8 to 4.8;
Choi and Lee 2017), resulting in slow partitioning from liver to
blood, which enhances the residence time in the metabolizing
liver. In addition, the glucuronidation rate was higher for BPAF
than for the other BPs in the concentration ranges observed in the
liver and the intestine (Figure 3). Contrarily, for BPS, peroral ex-
posure represented the predominant exposure route even for ado-
lescents and adults. BPS is more hydrophilic (logPow of about

est rate of all BPs in the concentration ranges present in the intes-
tine and the liver. The low glucuronidation rates might be an
important reason for the high internal concentrations of unconju-
gated BPS, which have also been observed in the biomonitoring
study by Oh et al. (2018). In this respect, the results of our kinetic
experiments are in good agreement with the pharmacokinetics
observed in humans. Measured concentrations of unconjugated
BPS were higher and measured concentrations of BPS-g were
lower than modeled, which implies that in vivo BPS glucuronida-
tion rates might be even lower than found in vitro.
Exposure diﬀerences between age groups in our model simu-
lations were mostly caused by the exposure patterns and anatomi-
cal diﬀerences of the diﬀerent age groups and genders (Tables 4
and S1). However, one should keep in mind that the glucuronida-
tion kinetics were assessed with adult hepatocytes, and the PBPK
models for BPA and BPS were calibrated with measurements in
adult body ﬂuids. Therefore, the exposure diﬀerences might
increase if age-group-speciﬁc metabolism parameters and biomo-
nitoring data were available.
For assessing the risk of BP analogs, potencies of their eﬀects
on endocrine receptors need to be taken into account as well, and
they have already been investigated with various assays. A study
investigating all compounds of interest in the MCF-7 Estrogen
Luciferase Reporter Assay on estrogen receptor binding found that
BPAF has a 13 times higher estrogenic potency than BPA (EC50 of
0.05 vs. 0:63 lM), whereas BPF and BPS showed a bit more than
half of the potency of BPA (EC50 of 1.0 and 1:1 lM) (Kitamura
et al. 2005). Other studies showed comparable tendencies (Fic et al.
2014; Skledar et al. 2016). Although BPAF showed the lowest se-
rum concentrations, it could therefore still be of the highest risk
regarding estrogenic activity. In a back-of-the-envelope calcula-
tion, we determined margins of exposure (MOE) for the diﬀerent
analogs according to MOE = EC50=Cmax with EC50 being the half-
maximal eﬀect concentration in the assay on estrogen receptor
binding (Kitamura et al. 2005) and Cmax being the highest blood or
gonadal concentration obtained in the basic PBPK model [Table 9,
external exposures for all BPs were assumed to be represented by
the upper estimate for external BPA exposure estimated by the
EFSA CEF (2015)]. The calculated MOE was the lowest for BPS
in serum and for BPAF in gonads with 2,440 and 1,810, respec-
tively, in comparison with BPA-MOEs of 12,000 and 4,670 in se-
rum and gonads, respectively. All those MOEs are well above 100,
which is considered a conservative margin (EFSA CEF 2015).
However, one should note that this calculation is based on estro-
genic potencies from one in vitro assay, and risk estimations should
be further reﬁned when additional studies on the BP analogs
become available. Regarding the results of the 2D-MC analysis
(Table 10, same external exposure estimates), the MOE in serum of
females of childbearing age was the lowest for BPAF, with 1,860
when regarding the P95/P95. The consideration of serum concentra-
tions of pregnant women is of special importance, because it was
shown that BPA can cross the placental barrier (Mørck et al.
2010). One third of fetal plasma levels investigated by
Schönfelder et al. (2002) were higher than the corresponding
maternal plasma levels, reaching concentrations up to 7 times
higher than the concentrations in corresponding maternal
plasma. This might be due to the comparatively low glucuronida-
tion and high deglucuronidation capacity in fetal compartments
(Lucier et al. 1977). With this worst-case estimation and internal
exposures from the 2D-MC analysis, the MOE between Cmax in
fetal serum and EC50 could reach values of 266, 1,070, 1,130,
and 2,040 for BPAF, BPS, BPA, and BPF, respectively. For
BPA, numerous studies on endocrine disrupting eﬀects were
conducted, and some of them found eﬀects at considerably lower
doses (Judy et al. 1999; Walsh et al. 2005) in comparison with
the study by Kitamura et al. (2005). Walsh et al. (2005) found an
EC50 of 0:10 nM for an increase of calcium ion concentration in
human breast-cancer cell lines. This eﬀect concentration could
lead to an MOE of 1.25 when regarding the Cmax of BPA (P95/
P95) in serum of females. Assuming worst-case accumulations
in the fetus, this would mean an MOE of 0.179 in fetal serum;
hence, no safety margin would exist. Such relations are equally
possible for other analogs such as BPAF, which has shown
higher eﬀects than BPA in many studies (Chen et al. 2016).
In summary, on the basis of our PBPK models we conclude
that a complete replacement of BPA with BPS might lead to ele-
vated BP concentrations in serum and a replacement with BPS or
BPAF might lead to increased estrogenic activities and lowered
MOEs compared to BPA.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that the replacement of BPA with structural ana-
logs may not lower the risk regarding endocrine disruption. With
the same peroral and dermal exposures for all BP analogs, our
model predicted that BPS exposure would result in the highest in-
ternal concentrations of unconjugated BPs in both serum and
gonads. Taking into account estrogenic agonistic potencies as
well, exposure to BPAF and BPS might be the most critical. The
contribution of dermal and peroral exposure to the total internal ex-
posure to unconjugated BPs varied among the analogs, with pero-
ral exposure being the most relevant route for BPS and dermal
exposure for BPAF. For a better understanding of the pharmacoki-
netic behavior of BP analogs, experiments on their hepatic and in-
testinal sulfation and their tissue-to-serum partitioning, and the
acquisition of additional in vivo toxicokinetic data for model cali-
bration and validation would be helpful.
